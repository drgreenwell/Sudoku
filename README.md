# Overview

This project is a Sudoku puzzle solver and generator game developed using Python. The game allows players to input and solve Sudoku puzzles. Players can manually enter numbers into the Sudoku grid, generate new puzzles, and solve existing puzzles. The game includes validation to prevent rule violations, ensuring that no duplicate numbers appear in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid. A sound effect is played if the player attempts to violate the Sudoku rules.

The purpose of this program was to create an interactive Sudoku game in Python that provides a fun and educational experience for players of all ages.
